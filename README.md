📢 Exciting Final Year Project 🚀🎓


🔍 Introducing "CurrencySense": Empowering the Visually Impaired with AI and IoT for Currency Identification! 💡💸

Imagine a future where visually impaired individuals can effortlessly identify currencies in real time, gaining independence and accessibility. Our innovative project, "CurrencySense," brings this vision to life by combining cutting-edge AI and IoT technologies.



Our project encompasses several key stages. Firstly, we curated a diverse dataset and pre-processed it, utilizing the COCO dataset and implementing an image annotation model using Roboflow. Next, we trained the Yolov5 algorithm using the annotated dataset, enabling it to learn and recognize various currencies. After detection, we leveraged eSpeak for text-to-speech conversion to provide voice output. To ensure real-time inference on captured images, we deployed the trained model on a Raspberry Pi.


I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my amazing group member Mamoona Khalid for her unwavering dedication, collaborative spirit, and invaluable contributions throughout this project. A special mention and sincere thanks go to our brilliant project supervisor Hafiz Muneeb Akhtar for their guidance, and constant support. 🙌

We are immensely proud of the outcomes we have achieved and the potential impact our project holds. Stay tuned for further updates on our journey! ✨
